## UOW Beamer class
### *Presentations with the UOW style in LaTeX*

Got rectangles? We do! And they scale according to the aspect ratio of the slides you chose with \documentclass[aspectratio=xxx{beamer}!

At the moment everything is blue (da-bu-dee da-bu-die?) will implement an option (or a keyvalue) to chose the colour of the presentation.

Need to include vision statement (and the option to remove it...)

Fix positioning of the UOW logo in the bottom right.

Lots of cleaning of the code. (So much cleaning to do.)
